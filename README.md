# COSC499-Team-GitHub-Exercise
Team GitHub Exercise for COSC499 2021W at UBC Okanagan 

This branch contains the JUnit Testing for each sorting algorithm.
Each test will run each sorting algorithm against a set sorted array and check to see if the sorting algorithm returns a sorted array.

Ensure you have JUnit 4 added to your Java Project build path or you will get errors.
